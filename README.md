# CMake_IAR_Template##
This is the project template to use CMake, IAR and Ninja build. Based on NXP TWR-KW24D512

##What is ninja build?##
Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.

##Environment setup requirement##
-Ninja build (There is a minimal version requirement, but I couldn't find it. Just use latest version.)
https://ninja-build.org, currently use the version v1.9.0

-CMake (There is a minimal version requirement, but I couldn't find it. Please use the version of 3.7.2 instead of the latest version)
	â€¢ Cmake --version   : 3.7.2
	https://cmake.org/files/v3.7/
-C++11
-python3.6.5
-IAR Embedded Workbench 8.30

##Setup##
1.Run python script "create_build_dirs.py" with python3.6+.
  Python.exe create_build_dirs_py
  
2.Run ninja build 
  ninja -C release
  or
  ninja -C debug
  
3.hello_world.bin will be generated under C:\Other_Code_Repo\CMake_IAR_Template\TWR-KW24D512\boards\twrkw24d512\demo_apps\hello_world\iar\debug\Exe
and C:\Other_Code_Repo\CMake_IAR_Template\TWR-KW24D512\boards\twrkw24d512\demo_apps\hello_world\iar\release\Exe

##Update&Modify##
a. Build configuration change
In python script "create_build_dirs.py", there is a cmds dictionary which contents configuration Vs. cmake commands. In our case, we use ninja build to get better speed. We can also alternate the build system by change value of "generator", such as "ninja" or "g++" according to what supported by CMake.

b. Adding files to project
There are two places we need to maintain, one is "project_sources.cmake". Whenever we add a new source file to project, we need to add reference to APP_SOURCE_FILES set in project_sources.cmake. If we add new folder to project, we need to update APP_INCLUDE_DIRS set in project_sources.cmake.

c. Other related files
-toolchain_iar.cmake: Configure the build toolchain for project, if we want to adapt this framework to other projects, this file needs update accordingly.
